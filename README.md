# CTFAirways

This repository contains the code for the CTFAirways task from WCTF2020 (for ESPR).

To run it locally just run `docker-compose up` on the players directory.

The exploit directory contains the solution, and the docs directory contains the information given to players and organizers.

A video write-up is available here:
